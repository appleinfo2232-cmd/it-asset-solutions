If you manage an IT fleet for a mid-to-large enterprise, the clock is ticking. Microsoft has officially confirmed that **Windows 10 will reach End of Support (EOS) on October 14, 2025**.

While that might seem far away, for an organization with 500+ endpoints, the logistics of a refresh cycle take months. Waiting until Q3 2025 to start planning your disposal strategy is a recipe for compliance failure and lost revenue.

At **IT Asset Solutions** in Farmington Hills, we are already seeing forward-thinking CIOs initiating their "Windows 11 Refresh" projects to avoid the rush.

## Why You Can't Just "Upgrade" Every Device
The problem isn't just software; it's hardware. Windows 11 has strict system requirements (TPM 2.0 chips, newer CPUs) that millions of perfectly good enterprise laptops simply do not meet.

**The Reality:** You will likely have to physically retire and replace a significant portion of your fleet.

This creates two massive challenges:
* **Data Security:** How do you securely wipe thousands of hard drives as they come offline?
* **Asset Value:** What do you do with thousands of 4-year-old laptops that are still functional but incompatible with your new OS?

## Turn Your "Incompatible" Fleet into Cash
This is where a strategic ITAD partner changes the game. Just because a laptop can't run Windows 11 doesn't mean it's trash.

The secondary market for Windows 10-era devices is still huge (schools, overseas markets, Linux users).
* **The Mistake:** Storing these devices in a closet until 2026. By then, their value will be $0.
* **The Win:** Liquidating them *now* while they still hold significant resale value.

## Your 2025 Refresh Checklist
To manage this transition securely, follow this workflow:

### 1. Audit Your Hardware Compatibility
Run a network scan to identify exactly which assets must be physically replaced versus those that can just be reimaged.

### 2. Schedule Rolling Pickups
Don't try to do it all in one week. Schedule monthly pickups with a secure logistics provider to keep your storage room clear and your data risk low.

### 3. Require Serialized Destruction Reports
For every device leaving your building, demand a **Certificate of Data Destruction**. If you are in healthcare or finance, this is non-negotiable for HIPAA/SOX compliance.

> **Pro Tip:** Don't let your old fleet depreciate to zero.
