## Key Takeaways
* **Location:** 23985 Industrial Park Dr, Farmington Hills, MI 48335
* **Hours:** Monday – Friday, 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM

Do you have a drawer full of old cables, a broken laptop collecting dust, or an old desktop tower sitting in your basement? You are not alone. Most households in Michigan have at least 3-4 old electronic devices ("e-waste") that they don't know how to dispose of.

You can’t just throw them in the trash—it’s illegal in Michigan because electronics contain toxic materials like lead and mercury. But finding a safe, responsible place to recycle them shouldn't be a headache.

If you live in **Farmington Hills, Novi, Southfield, or West Bloomfield**, IT Asset Solutions is your local, responsible answer.

## Is My Data Safe?
This is the #1 question we get. **Yes!**

Even for residential drop-offs, we treat your personal laptop with the exact same military-grade security we use for our bank and hospital clients.
* **Standard:** All hard drives are either digitally wiped (NIST 800-88 purge) or physically shredded.
* **Guarantee:** We do not browse, copy, or resell your personal data. It is destroyed immediately upon processing.

## Why Not the Landfill?
Electronics contain heavy metals that can leak into the groundwater if buried in a landfill. When you recycle with IT Asset Solutions, we harvest reusable materials (copper, gold, plastic) and reintroduce them into the manufacturing supply chain. This is called the **Circular Economy**, and by dropping off your old laptop, you are directly contributing to a cleaner Michigan.
