## The "Wild West" of Grading

If you have imported refurbished electronics before, you have likely experienced the "bait and switch." You order 100 units of "Grade A" laptops from a supplier, but when the container arrives, 30% of them have cracked bezels, white spots on the LCD, or shiny keyboards.

Why does this happen? Because in many regional hubs, grading is **subjective**. A trader might look at a laptop, wipe it with a cloth, and call it "New."

At **IT Asset Solutions**, we follow a different standard. Our grading is **objective** and based on strict R2v3 (Responsible Recycling) industry guidelines. Here is exactly what you should expect when you open a box from our Michigan facility.

> **The "Arm's Length" Rule:** A true Grade A device should look flawless when held at arm's length (roughly 18-24 inches). If you have to squint or hold it under a microscope to find a scratch, it passes. If the scratch catches your eye immediately, it fails.

## 1. Grade A: The "Retail Ready" Standard

This is our premium tier, designed for direct resale to end-users, corporate offices, or schools. When you buy Grade A from us, you are paying for cosmetic excellence.

**The Criteria:**
* **Screen:** 100% free of scratches, dead pixels, or "pressure marks" (white spots).
* **Keyboard:** No faded keys. Original matte finish is intact (no "shiny" keys from heavy typing).
* **Chassis:** No cracks or dents. Minor "hairline" scratches on the bottom case are permitted, but the top lid must be clean.
* **Ports:** All USB, HDMI, and charging ports are tested for tight connection and data transfer.

## 2. Grade B: The "Budget Performance" Standard

Grade B is where the profit margin often lives. These machines function perfectly (internally identical to Grade A) but show signs of life. These are perfect for call centers, warehouses, or cost-conscious students.

**The Criteria:**
* **Screen:** May have minor imperfections (1-2 small white spots) that are invisible when the screen is on.
* **Chassis:** Visible wear on corners, light dents, or security etchings that have been removed.
* **Value Proposition:** Grade B units typically cost **15-20% less** than Grade A, offering a massive ROI if your customer cares more about performance than aesthetics.

## 3. The Hidden Killer: Battery Health

A laptop can look brand new but be useless if the battery holds a charge for only 20 minutes. Many suppliers do not test batteries because it takes time.

**Our Standard:**
Every single unit—whether Grade A or Grade B—undergoes a digital battery health test.
* We guarantee a minimum of **80% original design capacity**.
* If a battery tests at 60%, we pull it and replace it, or sell the unit as "Grade C/Repair Stock."

## Why "US Grading" Commands Higher Resale Value

When you import from the USA, you are getting equipment that spent its life in a climate-controlled corporate office, usually docked to a monitor. It hasn't been carried around in a backpack in high humidity or dust.

This "Corporate Life" means the internal components (fan, motherboard, hinges) are often in mint condition, even if the case has a scratch.

## Summary Checklist for Buyers

Before you place your next bulk order with *any* supplier, ask them these three questions:

1.  **"Do you define Grade A by the R2 standard?"** (If they don't know what R2 is, run away).
2.  **"Do you guarantee a minimum 80% battery health?"**
3.  **"Can I see a video of the specific lot before I wire the money?"**

## The Bottom Line

Quality control is the difference between a one-time transaction and a long-term partnership. We invite you to test our grading yourself.
